How to Develop locally:
Since we now have a databse, you have to initialize it using the files initDB.js and data.json. It doesn't work outside vagrant (I think) since you need MongoDB.

 $ node initDB.js

 You only need to do this once, unless you want to reset the databse to it's base state (what's in data.json).

 Then you can run app.js as you usually do.

 $ node app.js
